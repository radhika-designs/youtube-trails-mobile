## 🎨 Visual Design

### **Scrollable Card Format:**

Each card shows:
- **Large icon** (36px emoji)
- **Title** (18px, bold)
- **Subtitle** (12px, secondary)
- **Full content** (all original details preserved)
- **Alternating backgrounds** (white/gray for visual rhythm)

### **Navigation:**
- Header: "Complete Guide" with back button
- Intro banner: Purple gradient
- Cards: Stacked vertically, scroll to see all
- Footer: "Start Using Trails" button

## 💡 Why This Works Better

### **1. No Information Overload**
Users aren't bombarded with information before they need it

### **2. Just-in-Time Learning**
Users access help when they're actually confused, not preemptively

### **3. Better Retention**
Reading documentation while using the app = higher retention

### **4. User Control**
- Scroll at own pace
- Skip sections
- Jump to any feature (no sequential lock)
- Return anytime

### **5. Reference Guide**
It's now a **documentation page**, not an onboarding flow
