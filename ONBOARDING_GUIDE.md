## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### **Visual Elements:**

1. **Progress Dots:** 10 dots showing current step
2. **Large Emoji Icons:** Visual anchors for each feature (64px)
3. **Hierarchy:**
   - Title (24px, bold)
   - Subtitle (14px, secondary)
   - Content cards (labeled sections)
   - Tips in colored boxes

### **Navigation:**

- **Primary Button:** "Next" (blue, right side)
- **Secondary Button:** "Back" or "Skip" (outlined, left side)
- **Step Counter:** "X of 10" at bottom

### **Interaction:**

- **Back Navigation:** All steps except first have "Back"
- **Completion:** Last step has "Get Started" instead of "Next"
- **Auto-transition:** Finishing onboarding enables Trail Feed

---

## 🔄 Replay Onboarding

Users can restart the tutorial anytime:

**Path:** Profile → Help & Tutorial

**Function:** `restartOnboarding()`
- Resets to Step 1
- Shows overlay again
- Useful for new users or feature refreshers

---

## 💡 Design Rationale

### **Why 10 Steps?**

Each feature deserves dedicated explanation. Grouping would dilute impact.

### **Why Overlay Modal?**

- Non-intrusive (can skip)
- Focused attention (darkened background)
- Progressive disclosure (one concept at a time)
- Mobile-friendly (centered card)

### **Why Auto-Enable Trail Feed at End?**

Users should immediately experience the core feature they just learned about. Starting with Trail Feed creates an "aha moment."

### **Why Include "Why It Matters"?**

Users don't just need to know WHAT a feature does — they need to understand WHY they should care. Each step includes value props.

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### **Ideal User Journey:**

1. User completes 8-10 steps (80%+ completion rate)
2. User interacts with Trail Feed immediately after
3. User creates or follows a Trail within first session
4. User returns to Profile → Help & Tutorial if confused

### **Red Flags:**

- High skip rate on Step 1 (content not engaging)
- Drop-off at specific steps (that step needs simplification)
- Low replay rate (tutorial wasn't helpful)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **State Management:**

```javascript
state: {
    showOnboarding: true,    // Controls overlay visibility
    onboardingStep: 0,       // Current step (0-9)
}
```

### **Functions:**

- `onboardingNext()` — Advance to next step
- `onboardingBack()` — Return to previous step
- `skipOnboarding()` — Close overlay
- `finishOnboarding()` — Complete & enable Trail Feed
- `restartOnboarding()` — Replay from Step 1

### **Data Structure:**

```javascript
onboardingSteps = [
    {
        icon: '🎬',
        title: 'Welcome to YouTube Trails!',
        subtitle: 'Organize your viewing...',
        content: `<div>...</div>`
    },
    // ... 9 more steps
]
```
